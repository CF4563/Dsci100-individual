DSCI100 Individual Planning project

Data Description:
The datasets that we have been given are the sessions and players files, which are data collected from the Minecraft study. There were 196 observations in the players.csv file, with each observation being information on a participant. They recorded 7 variables: their experience, subscription, email, name, gender, age, and time played. One problem I can see in the data is that there are many accounts that have 0 hours played and will not help me with my calculations. The other dataset is sessions.csv and has 1535 observations, meaning that people opened the game 1535 times. There are 5 variables: the player's email, start time, end time, original start time, and end time.

Questions:

The question that I will address is whether age and skill level have any correlation with the amount of time spent on the game and if the age and skill level could help predict the amount of time they might spend on the game. I could first filter out all of the accounts that don't have any time spent on the game, as we are dealing with people who actually played the game. I could separate all the data in players.csv into 2 new datasets containing skill level and time played as well as the age and time played. I could use summary statistics to calculate the average time spent on the game by each skill level as well as age.
